#+TITLE:Search Engines for Nyxt

Here you can find search engines for Nyxt browser. The aim of this
extension is to get rid of balck box world of search bookmarklets and
search cookies by moving the pretty land of lispy syntax and small
helper functions generating search URIs.

As an example, instead of fiddling with [[https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/search.html][websites for search
bookmarklets]], you can define the DuckDuckGo search engine with
Terminal theme, instant answers turned off, and autocomplete
suggestions turned off with just a simple call to:

#+begin_src lisp
  (nx-search-engines:duckduckgo :theme "terminal"
                                :instant-answers nil :autocomplete nil)
#+end_src

This will return your new fancy DuckDuckGo engine that you can append
to the =search-engines= in buffer configuration.

#+begin_src lisp
  (define-configuration buffer
    ((search-engines (append %slot-default
                             (list (nx-search-engines:duckduckgo
                                    :theme "terminal"
                                    :instant-answers nil
                                    :autocomplete nil)))))
#+end_src
